We love Spring, and this navy, blush and gold wedding started off the season on the perfect note! These two began their day surrounded by their closest friends and family, preparing themselves for the important moments ahead. The groomsmen dressed in navy and the bridesmaids in blush. After a private first look between bride and groom, they continued the celebration around town with the bridal party at a few of Kansas City’s most treasured photo locations.</li>
<br><br>
<li>
Next stop – the church! Where they exchanged vows, made eternal promises to one another, and became husband and wife. After a beautiful ceremony, guests sent off the bride and groom with a lavender toss outside.
<br><br></li>
<li>
While guests anxiously awaited the arrival of the bridal party, they enjoyed a cocktail hour featuring an open bar and tasty appetizers. Navy, blush and gold wedding details everywhere!
<br<br></li>
<li>
The guests then gathered around their seats prepared for the bridal party’s entrance. But this wasn’t just any entrance- this one bled red and gold! When it comes to the Kansas City Chiefs, Megan and Nate are true super fans, and they proved it with one of the most fun entrances we’ve seen yet! With some help from the always-entertaining DJ Fernando and an impressive red light/smoke machine combination, Megan and Nate’s entrance rivaled that of a Chiefs player running onto the field of Arrowhead!
<br><br></li>
<li>
    The electrifying grand entrance set the mood for a fun-filled night at the charming Rumely Tractor Historic Event Space located in Kansas City’s West Bottoms district. The night began with touching remarks by the father-of-the-bride, followed by a delicious buffet style dinner presented by Plaza Catering, and speeches from the Maid of Honor and the Best Man, all of which had people laughing and sniffling.</li>
<br><br>
Dinner was followed by Megan and Nate cutting into a beautiful four tier cake designed by Shannon Bond Cake Design. Guests then had the almost impossible choice between blueberry cake with lemon buttercream, vanilla with salted caramel, and strawberry with strawberry buttercream, all of which were crowd pleasers!
</li>
    <br><br><li>
After a good sugar rush, it was time to boogy! DJ Fernando kept the guests on the dance floor the entire night with his mix of new and classic songs. The bouquet was tossed, the garter was thrown and the memories were made!
